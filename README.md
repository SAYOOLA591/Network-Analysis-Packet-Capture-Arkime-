# Network Analysis Packet Capture (ARKIME)

## Introduction to Arkime

Arkime is a powerful open-source full-network capture system, ideal for organizations needing to capture and analyze PCAPs data at high speed. Its scalability makes it an excellent choice for growing needs, it can handles multiple PCAPs by ingesting, indexing, and enabling seamless search across them using Elasticsearch database, the technology that powers Arkime.

## Architecture

**Capture Nodes**: Arkime uses capture nodes that collect and store network packets. These nodes can handle high volumes of traffic, making Arkime suitable for large organizations.

**Elasticsearch**: Arkime integrates with Elasticsearch to index packet data, making it easy to search through terabytes of PCAP files.

**Web Interface**: Highlight Arkime's web interface, which allows for easy packet analysis, visualization, and the application of search filters.

## Key Features

**Full Packet Capture**: Arkime can capture and store full network packets, providing deep insights into network traffic, unlike some tools that only capture metadata.

**Search and Query**: Arkime's most powerful features is its ability to quickly search and query massive amounts of data. You can search using fields like IP addresses, protocols, or even specific string patterns in packets.

**Scalability**: Arkime is highly scalable, with the ability to run on multiple nodes across large networks, indexing millions of packets per second.

**Integration with Threat Intelligence**: Arkime can integrate with external threat intelligence feeds to flag suspicious activity in real-time.

## Use Case

**Incident Response**: Facilitates forensic analysis by allowing security teams to quickly search and retrieve specific network traffic related to a security incident.

**Threat Hunting**: Enables proactive identification of suspicious activity by analyzing indexed PCAPs for anomalous patterns or behaviors.

**Compliance Auditing**: Helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by providing detailed visibility and logs of network traffic for audits.

**Performance Troubleshooting**: Assists in diagnosing network performance issues by analyzing packet-level details and identifying bottlenecks or misconfigurations.

**Malware Analysis**: Supports in-depth investigation of malicious activity by capturing and analyzing network traffic associated with malware communications.

**Training and Simulation**: Useful in cybersecurity labs and training programs to simulate attack scenarios and analyze network traffic patterns.
